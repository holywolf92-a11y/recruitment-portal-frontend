### Auto-Deploy Status

✅ **Auto-deploy is ENABLED** - Railway automatically deploys when code is pushed to `main` branch.

Since the code was pushed to GitHub, Railway should automatically:
1. Detect the push (usually within 1-2 minutes)
2. Start building (2-3 minutes)
3. Deploy the new version (1-2 minutes)

**Total deployment time:** ~5-7 minutes from push

## 📋 Manual Deployment (if needed)

If auto-deploy didn't trigger, you can manually deploy:

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/f6697836-a039-4c9c-aa26-c659dc634b86
2. Click on the frontend service
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
5. Or click "Deploy" to trigger a new deployment

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```powershell
cd "D:\falisha\recruitment-portal-frontend"
railway login  # Authenticate first
railway link --project f6697836-a039-4c9c-aa26-c659dc634b86
git push origin main
```

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. **Auto-refresh documents** - Documents refresh automatically after upload
2. **Real API data** - Fetches documents from database instead of mock data
3. **Correct API endpoints** - Fixed 502 errors by using correct routes
4. **Category mapping** - Maps API categories to display format
